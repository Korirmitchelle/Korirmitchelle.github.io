A **loop** statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages.


# Enhanced for loop in Java:

As of Java 5, the enhanced for loop was introduced. This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.

## Syntax:
The syntax of enhanced for loop is:

    for(declaration : expression)
           {Enhanced for loop in Java:
As of Java 5, the enhanced for loop was introduced. This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.


+ Declaration: The newly declared block variable, which is of a type compatible with the elements of the array you are accessing. The variable will be available within the for block and its value would be the same as the current array element.

- Expression: This evaluates to the array you need to loop through. The expression can be an array variable or method call that returns an array.

## Example:
    public class Test {

     public static void main(String args[]){
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

      for(int x : numbers ){
         System.out.print( x );
         System.out.print(",");
      }
      System.out.print("\n");
      String [] names ={"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};
      for( String name : names ) {
         System.out.print( name );
         System.out.print(",");
      }
     }
    }

     //Statements
     }
