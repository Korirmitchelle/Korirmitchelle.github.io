title: Pretty Hurts...

Beauty is important I concur but it isn’t everything. It is sad how the first thing we notice about a person is their looks. Well I’d say beauty with brains is the ideal blend. But now there is a debate;between beauty and brains; which is best?


Most people are prejudiced towards beauty in that the beautiful are favored for instance in an interview on account of their looks. I trust insofar as one is skillful,they should be effective in spite of their looks. In the end, whether you are light skinned, dark skinned, fair of complexion or a sight to frighten young ones, if you can play out an assignment to finishing and get credits on it, isn't that what matters?

Beauty contests today apply this; How the questions are answered says a lot about a person and is generally utilized as a deciding component.Some of the most brilliantly answered are:


**Lara Dutta of India - Miss Universe 2000**


**Question:** Right now there is a protest going on right outside here calling the Miss Universe Pageant disrespectful of women. Convince them they are wrong.

**Lara's Answer:** "I think pageant I think pageants like the Miss Universe pageant gives us young women a platform to foray in the fields that we want to and forge ahead, be it entrepreneurship, be it the armed force, be it politics. It gives us a platform to voice our choices and opinions, and makes us strong, independent that we are today. "

Brilliant right? It depicts how ambitious a woman is and her future aspirations and how she maneuvers her way into success. It is quite a shame for one to loose a beauty contest  simply because they failed to answer a question as expected.

Lets not tear each other down with mean and destructive remarks due myths that are unwarranted. Lead the pack from Steve Jobs, and let us fabricate a greater, brighter future. Looks aside!
