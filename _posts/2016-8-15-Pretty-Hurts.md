title: Pretty Hurts...

Beauty is important I agree but it isn't everything.it is sad how the first thing we notice about a person is their looks.Well I'd say beauty with brains is the perfect combination.But now there is a debate;between beauty and brains; which is best?


Most people are prejudiced towards beauty in that the beautiful are favored for instance in an interview simply because of their looks.I believe as so long as one is skillfull,they ought to be successful despite their looks.
