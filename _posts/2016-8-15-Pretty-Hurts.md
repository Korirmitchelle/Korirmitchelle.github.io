title: Pretty Hurts...

Beauty is important I agree but it isn't everything.it is sad how the first thing we notice about a person is their looks.Well I'd say beauty with brains is the perfect combination.But now there is a debate;between beauty and brains; which is best?


Most people are prejudiced towards beauty in that the beautiful are favored for instance in an interview simply because of their looks.I believe so long as one is skillfull,they ought to be successful despite their looks.

Beauty contests today apply this; How the questions are answered says alot about a person and is mostly used as a determining factor.One of the most brilliantly answered are:


**Lara Dutta of India - Miss Universe 2000**


**Question:** Right now there is a protest going on right outside here calling the Miss Universe Pageant disrespectful of women. Convince them they are wrong.

**Lara's Answer:** "I think pageant I think pageants like the Miss Universe pageant gives us young women a platform to foray in the fields that we want to and forge ahead, be it entrepreneurship, be it the armed force, be it politics. It gives us a platform to voice our choices and opinions, and makes us strong, independent that we are today. "

Brilliant right? It depicts how ambitious a woman is and her future aspirations and how she manouvers her way into success. It is quite a shame for one to loose a beauty contest  simply because they failed to answer a question as expected.
