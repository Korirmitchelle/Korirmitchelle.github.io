Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization.


**Responsive web design** is an approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal view and interaction experience – easy reading and viewing despite the device properties such as screen size, orientation and platform.


The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries; and eliminates the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market. I also incorporated CSS3 and HTML5 to the front-end of my sites that I developed.
**Wending** involves back-end and front-end designs and development.


## Front-end Web Design


The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders, is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser.


Front-end developers are responsible for a website’s user-facing code and the architecture of its immersive user experiences. In order to execute those objectives, front-end developers must be adept at three main languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming. 

In addition to fluency in these languages, front-end developers need to be familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS, which ensure great-looking content no matter the device, and libraries like jQuery and LESS, which package code into a more useful, time-saving form. A lot of front-end developer job listings also call for experience with Ajax, a widely used technique for using JavaScript that lets pages dynamically load by downloading server data in the background.

## Back-end Web Design


The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.


In order to make the server, application, and database communicate with each other, back-end developers use server-side languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net to build an application, and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user in front-end code. Back-end developing often also calls for experience with PHP frameworks like Zend, Symfony, and CakePHP; experience with version control software like SVN, CVS, or Git; and experience with Linux as a development and deployment system.
